Yesterday I received an email from Apple that the Beta test program for iOS 10 has officially been released. I decided to go ahead and install iOS 10 on my iPhone 6 last night. After deleting the previous beta test profile, I was able to quickly download the beta, update my iPhone and begin to experience the updated operating system.

After a little less than 24 hours, I thought it would be good to post my initial thoughts:

**Likes**

The ability to communicate through instant messaging now has a couple of new features. From handwriting to the ability to add a personal touch to any message, Apple has really put some thought and effort into the entire experience.

The Notification center has been revamped and I like it! Completely available from the locked screen you can quickly flip through the weather, news and upcoming events on my calendar with the swipe of a thumb.

I am a Google News user. For the last 10 years I’ve read all of my news on Google, but the updated News program is making me rethink my daily routine. Once you setup everything, it’s quick and easy to read or ignore what’s going on in the world.

**Dislikes**

Call me old fashion but I liked it when Facebook only had a like button. With Apple’s new Tapback function you can instantly react to a text message with 6 options which I need to accept as the market heads that direction.

I am conditioned to opening my phone with a quick swipe. With the new update you are required to click on the home button and authenticate via the code of thumbprint. Not a huge dislike more than a need to change my behavior to use the device more efficiently.

All things considered, my first 24 hours with iOS 10 has been seamless without issue. Over the next couple of weeks I’ll take note of any issues and update this article.

Here are a few friendly reminders before making the jump to the new operating system:

1. Always backup your phone before performing updates. Backing up is really all about restoring, if you don’t have a backup then you can’t restore if you need to.

2. Keep in mind, the full version is not releasing until Fall 2016. This is a beta and will come with a few issues here and there. With that being said, issues should be few and far between.
