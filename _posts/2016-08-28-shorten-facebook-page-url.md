Customers often ask us how to shorten their Facebook URL. It’s important to note that you must be an administrator of the page where you are trying to shorten the URL and must have at least 25 likes on the page for this to work. Also, once you assign your URL you can only change it once so it’s always good to write out your options and make sure you are picking the best one possible the first time around.

1) Login to you Facebook account and navigate to [Facebook Username][facebook].

2) Select the dropdown next to Page: and choose your Facebook page.

3) Type your chosen username in the text box and click on Check Availability.

4) If the name is available, select it and now your Facebook URL will be shortened.

[facebook]: https://facebook.com/username
