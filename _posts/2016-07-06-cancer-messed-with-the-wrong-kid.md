Earlier tonight, I was scrolling through my newsfeed and came across a high school classmate who was sharing how her daughter was recently diagnosed with Leukemia. My mind started racing and flashbacks of how we spent our Independence Day quickly ran through my head and then things slowed down, it sunk in!


### **What would I do if Whittman was facing that diagnosis?**


Childhood Cancer is not fair! A little over a month ago, I started working with the Isabella Santos Foundation here in the Ballantyne area of Charlotte and learned that typically just a small percentage of all funds raised for Cancer research are designated towards childhood specific cancers. ISF has donated over $1,000,000 dollars over the last six years to help fight Neuroblastoma and support other cancer charities.

Over the next few months, I’m going to train for a 5K, working on becoming both physically and mentally fit for my family, future and most importantly every child facing Cancer worldwide.


### **I need your help and every dollar counts!**
