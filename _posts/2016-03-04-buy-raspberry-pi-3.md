When I heard about the new Raspberry Pi 3 a few days ago, I was really excited to check out the built in Wifi and upgraded processer. I think most shoppers were surprised when they announced the $35 price point matching the Pi 2. The reality is that if you want to purchase the microcomputer, you’re going to pay a little bit of a premium because it’s a hot item. I don’t know anyone in Charlotte that is selling them locally but maybe I’m wrong.

I’m an Amazon shopper and of course pulled up the app and looked for the Pi late last night. The reality is that you can’t buy one for $35 online right.

**_Where Can I Buy A Raspberry Pi 3 Right Now?_**

* RS Components is currently charging **[$54.99](https://www.amazon.com/RS-COMPONENTS-Raspberry-Model-Board/dp/B01C6FRVQM/ref=sr_1_4?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1457108513&sr=1-4&keywords=raspberry+pi+3)** with Prime shipping which isn’t cheap but may be worth the extra 36%. If you have to have it now, it may not be a bad value.

* CanaKit is offering a RPi 3 kit for **[$79.99](https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Starter-Kit/dp/B01C6Q2GSY/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1457108513&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=raspberry+pi+3&psc=1)** (should ship on March 6th fulfilled by Amazon) which isn’t terrible if you need the power cord and sd card. This kit comes packed with a case, an HDMI cable and heatsinks.

* MCM Electronics showed up in my Google Search Results with a project kit for **[$82.99](http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/83-16563RK?scode=GS401&utm_medium=cse&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=google&gclid=CPzrg9G4p8sCFdcRgQod3xMP0g)**. If you want to learn about electronics and maximize the 40pin GPIO port, this is your best bet.
